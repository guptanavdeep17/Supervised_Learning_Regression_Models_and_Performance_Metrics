        "# Question 4: Provide a real-world example where simple linear regression can be applied.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  * A common real-world example of **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)** is predicting **house prices based on house size**. In this case, the **dependent variable (Y)** is the price of the house, and the **independent variable (X)** is the size of the house in square feet. By collecting data on several houses, such as their sizes and selling prices, we can use SLR to find a straight-line relationship between the two. For instance, the model might be expressed as *Price = 20 + 0.045 √ó (Size)*, where 20 represents the base price (in lakhs) when the size is zero, and 0.045 indicates that for every additional square foot, the price increases by ‚Çπ4,500 on average. This model helps real estate agents and buyers **predict the price of a house** based on its area and understand how **size influences cost**. Simple Linear Regression is widely applied in such cases where one variable depends directly on another, such as predicting student marks from study hours or estimating sales based on advertising spend.\n",

        "# Question 5: What is the method of least squares in linear regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The **method of least squares** is a statistical technique used in **linear regression** to find the best-fitting straight line through a set of data points. It works by minimizing the **sum of the squared differences** between the actual observed values and the values predicted by the regression line. These differences, known as **residuals or errors**, represent how far each data point is from the fitted line. By squaring and summing these errors, the method ensures that both positive and negative deviations are treated equally, and that larger errors are given more weight. The goal is to find the line that makes this total squared error as small as possible. Mathematically, the regression line is expressed as ( Y = b_0 + b_1X ), where ( b_0 ) is the intercept and ( b_1 ) is the slope. The least squares method calculates these values so that the line best represents the relationship between the independent variable ( X ) and the dependent variable ( Y ). This approach is widely used because it provides the most accurate and reliable linear fit under normal statistical conditions.\n",

        "# Question 6: What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        " * Logistic Regression is a statistical method used to predict the probability of a categorical (usually binary) outcome based on one or more independent variables. Unlike Linear Regression, which predicts continuous values, Logistic Regression predicts discrete outcomes, such as Yes/No, Pass/Fail, or Spam/Not Spam.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Logistic Regression, the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is modeled using a sigmoid (S-shaped) curve, which converts the linear output into a probability value between 0 and 1.\n",

        "    MAE measures the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted values. It shows how far, on average, the predictions are from the actual outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * 2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",

        "  * The R-squared (R¬≤) metric, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures how well a regression model explains the variability of the dependent variable using the independent variable(s).
